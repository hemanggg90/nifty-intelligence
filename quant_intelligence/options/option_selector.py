"""
Option Contract Selection.

Pure logic, no network calls - takes an already-fetched ChainSnapshot and
resolves a strategy's directional Setup into a concrete tradeable option
contract. Every underlying that can be traded must resolve via
`get_underlying_info` (security id + segment + strike step + lot size):
the two indices below are statically registered; any other symbol is
resolved dynamically as an NSE F&O stock via
`data_adapters.dhan_instrument_master.resolve_fno_stock` (backed by Dhan's
own scrip master, so the tradeable stock universe stays in sync with NSE's
actual listings without a hand-maintained list).

Direction mapping (LONG/SHORT are the strategy's view on the underlying,
independent of whether the resulting option trade is a BUY or a SELL):
  LONG  -> the bullish leg -> CE
  SHORT -> the bearish leg -> PE
A strategy that wants to profit from the underlying falling can equally do
so by SELLING a CE (transaction="SELL", option_type comes out as CE) - the
`transaction` parameter is independent of `direction`.
