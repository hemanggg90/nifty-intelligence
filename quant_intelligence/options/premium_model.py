"""
Premium translation: underlying index-point stop/target -> option-premium stop/target.

An option's premium does not move 1:1 with its underlying - it moves
approximately `delta` points of premium per point of underlying, and that
relationship itself decays (gamma) as the underlying moves further, and
decays over time (theta) regardless of underlying movement. Delta-scaling is
a standard, transparent first-order approximation: it is NOT exact,
especially close to expiry (high gamma) or for far-OTM strikes (delta drifts
fast). Treat the resulting stop/target as an estimate to monitor against
live premium, not a guarantee - the actual exit is always driven by the
live/paper LTP crossing the computed level, never by the underlying's price.

Risk sizing reuses the existing risk_engine.evaluate_trade unchanged: this
module's whole job is to produce a premium-denominated (entry_price,
stop_price) pair that flows into the same ProposedTrade fields that already
work for index-point strategies.
