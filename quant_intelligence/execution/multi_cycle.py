"""One paper-trading scan cycle across many instruments, ALL traded as options.

Indices (SETTINGS.option_underlyings) and stocks are each run through the research pipeline and,
when a setup triggers, resolved to an option contract from the live chain and paper-traded
via `run_auto_option_cycle`. Shared by 07_Paper_Trading ("All instruments together" mode) and
13_Auto_Multi_Stock_Trading. Streamlit-free: callers pass the account-state getter and
apply the returned P&L to their own session state.
