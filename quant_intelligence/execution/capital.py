"""Capital accounting for the paper account.

PaperBroker only moves `cash` when a position CLOSES (realised P&L); it does not deduct the
premium when an option is bought. So funds already committed to open positions must be
derived from the positions themselves - that is what `capital_summary` does.

For a bought option (or long stock) the outlay is entry price x quantity. For a SOLD option
only the premium value is known here; the exchange margin requirement is NOT modelled, so
`sell_premium_value` is informational and is not counted as used capital.
