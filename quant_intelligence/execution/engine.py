"""Process-wide paper-trading engine.

Owns the shared PaperBroker, the daily risk counters and the kill switch, and runs the
auto-trading scan in a background thread. Because it lives at module level (not in a
Streamlit session or page), switching pages - or closing the browser tab - does not stop it;
only `stop()` (or the server restarting / the cloud app sleeping) does.

A second runner (`COMMODITY_RUNNER`) scans MCX commodities on its own thread and session
hours while borrowing the NSE engine's broker, counters and kill switch, so both draw on one
shared cash pool.

Streamlit-free on purpose: a background thread has no ScriptRunContext, so nothing here
may call `st.*`.
