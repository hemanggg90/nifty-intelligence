"""
Strategy Ranking & NO-TRADE Engine.

Transparent scoring: combines conditional expected R, probability of positive
return, confidence/sample quality, drawdown/risk character, and a cost
penalty into one visible score per strategy. Every component is exposed so
the UI can show exactly why a strategy ranked where it did - nothing is a
black box.

NO-TRADE is a first-class outcome, chosen when:
  - No strategy clears a minimum expected-edge bar after costs.
  - The best strategy's confidence is LOW/INSUFFICIENT_DATA.
  - The gap between the top two strategies is not practically significant.
  - Data quality is not OK.
