"""
Regime Engine.

Transparent, rule/statistical regime classifier (no deep learning). Produces
a probability distribution over regimes rather than a single hard label, so
downstream conditional-expectancy calculations can weight by regime
similarity and the UI can show classifier confidence honestly.

Regimes: TREND_UP, TREND_DOWN, RANGE, COMPRESSION, VOL_EXPANSION,
VOL_CONTRACTION, HIGH_VOL, LOW_VOL, EVENT_DRIVEN, LIQUIDITY_STRESS.

Method: each regime has a scoring rule built from already-computed features
(trend_slope, momentum, atr_percentile, vol_expansion, relative_volume,
market_structure, expiry_proximity). Scores are converted into a probability
distribution via a softmax, which is a standard, transparent way to turn
multiple weak evidence signals into calibrated-looking probabilities without
hiding the logic in a black box. The label is the argmax; the full
distribution (and thus confidence = max probability) is always stored.
